## Overview
**Task**: Feature Flag System Implementation  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes  
**Dependencies**: TASK-004 (Tenant Resolution Middleware)

## Task Scope
**INCLUDED in Task-005**:
- Core feature flag service with database operations
- Redis caching for performance 
- API endpoints for feature management
- Input validation and sanitization
- TypeScript types for feature system

**NOT INCLUDED** (other tasks):
- JWT authentication (TASK-006)
- Authorization middleware (TASK-006)
- React hooks (TASK-007/008)
- UI components (TASK-007/008)
- Admin dashboard integration (TASK-008)

## Functional Requirements ✅

### Core Feature Flag Operations
- [ ] **Feature Retrieval**: System can retrieve tenant-specific feature flags from database
- [ ] **Feature Updates**: System can update individual or multiple feature flags per tenant
- [ ] **Default Configuration**: New tenants receive appropriate default feature settings
- [ ] **Feature Types**: Support for 'orders', 'loyalty', and 'menu' feature flags
- [ ] **Cache Integration**: Feature flags are cached in Redis for performance

### API Endpoints
- [ ] **GET /api/features**: Returns current tenant's enabled features
- [ ] **PUT /api/features**: Updates tenant's feature configuration
- [ ] **Response Format**: Consistent JSON response format with success/error states
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized

### Database Operations
- [ ] **Upsert Logic**: Feature updates use INSERT...ON CONFLICT for efficiency
- [ ] **Tenant Scoping**: All queries properly scoped to tenant ID
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Feature names restricted to valid values
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps maintained

## Technical Requirements ✅

### TypeScript Implementation
- [ ] **Type Safety**: All feature-related types properly defined
- [ ] **Interface Contracts**: Clear interfaces for API requests/responses
- [ ] **Enum Usage**: Feature names defined as type union for type safety
- [ ] **No Type Errors**: Code compiles without TypeScript errors

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Response Time**: Feature retrieval < 200ms (cached), < 500ms (uncached)
- [ ] **Cache Strategy**: Redis caching with 1-hour TTL
- [ ] **Cache Invalidation**: Cache properly invalidated on feature updates
- [ ] **Database Efficiency**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System returns default features on cache/DB failure
- [ ] **Error Logging**: All errors properly logged with context
- [ ] **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid feature configurations
- [ ] **Transaction Safety**: Database operations are atomic

## Security Requirements ✅

### Data Security (Task-005 scope)
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**: All queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: User inputs properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Sensitive Data**: No sensitive information in logs or error messages
- [ ] **Cache Security**: Redis keys properly scoped to prevent leakage

## Code Quality Requirements ✅

### Code Structure
- [ ] **File Organization**: Code organized in appropriate directories
  - `app/types/features.ts` - TypeScript types
  - `app/lib/features.ts` - Business logic
  - `app/lib/validation.ts` - Input validation
  - `app/routes/api.features.ts` - API endpoints
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, business, and API layers
- [ ] **Reusability**: Feature service class designed for reuse

### Code Standards
- [ ] **ESLint Compliance**: Code passes ESLint checks without warnings
- [ ] **Prettier Formatting**: Code properly formatted with Prettier
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complex logic documented with comments

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Core business logic covered by unit tests
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API endpoints tested with proper auth/tenant context
- [ ] **Error Case Testing**: Error scenarios properly tested
- [ ] **Cache Testing**: Redis caching behavior verified

## Integration Requirements ✅

### System Integration
- [ ] **Tenant Middleware**: Integrates with existing tenant resolution
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Compatible with existing database structure
- [ ] **Redis Integration**: Uses existing Redis connection and configuration

## Documentation Requirements ✅

### Code Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Clear documentation of API endpoints and responses
- [ ] **Type Documentation**: TypeScript interfaces properly documented
- [ ] **Usage Examples**: Examples of how to use the feature flag system
- [ ] **Integration Guide**: Instructions for frontend integration

### Architecture Documentation

- [ ] **Performance Considerations**: Performance optimizations documented

## Testing Checklist ✅

### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Feature Retrieval**: Can successfully get tenant features via API
- [ ] **Feature Updates**: Can successfully update features via API
- [ ] **Permission Testing**: Non-owners cannot modify features
- [ ] **Cross-Tenant**: Features properly isolated between tenants
- [ ] **Cache Testing**: Features cached and invalidated correctly

### Automated Testing

## Notes
- All checkboxes must be completed before task is considered "Done"
- Any exceptions or modifications must be documented and approved
- This definition of done serves as both a checklist and quality gate
- Implementation should follow the detailed plan in `docs/PLAN_BREAKDOWN/task-005-feature-flag-system.md`

**Final Verification**: Task is complete when all items are checked, all tests pass, and the feature flag system is successfully integrated with the GrowPlate platform.
