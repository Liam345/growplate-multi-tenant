## Specific Feature Cards Requirements

### Order Management Card
- **Display Condition**: `tenant.features.includes('orders')`
- **Icon**: Order/receipt icon
- **Title**: "Order Management"
- **Description**: "Manage incoming orders, track status, and process payments"

## Acceptance Tests

### Test Scenarios
1. **All Features Enabled**: Dashboard shows all three feature cards
2. **Only Orders Enabled**: Dashboard shows only Order Management card
3. **No Features Enabled**: Dashboard shows appropriate empty state
4. **Feature Toggle**: Features can be enabled/disabled and dashboard updates
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Cards stack properly on small screens
6. **Navigation**: Clicking cards navigates to correct routes (may be placeholder)

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 500ms with cached data
- [ ] No layout shift during feature flag loading
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

## Dependencies Verification
- [ ] TASK-005 (Feature Flag System) is complete and functional
