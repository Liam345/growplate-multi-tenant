âœ… TASK-003 Definition of Done

  âœ… Core Requirements Met:

  1. PostgreSQL Connection â†’ app/lib/db.ts with connection pooling
  2. Redis Connection â†’ app/lib/redis.ts with tenant-scoped caching
  3. TypeScript Interfaces â†’ app/types/database.ts with all schema types
  4. Environment Configuration â†’ .env.example with all database variables
  5. Testing Validation â†’ All TypeScript compilation passes

  âœ… Quality Gates Passed:

  - Type Safety: All TypeScript errors resolved
  - Connection Pooling: PostgreSQL pool configured (2-10 connections)
  - Tenant Isolation: Redis keys are tenant-scoped with growplate:tenant:${tenantId}: prefix
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Health Monitoring: Built-in health check functions for both databases
  - Graceful Shutdown: Proper connection cleanup on process termination

  âœ… Features Implemented:

  - Multi-tenant Queries: Automatic tenant_id injection for data isolation
  - Connection Health: Health check endpoints for monitoring
  - Cache Utilities: Tenant-scoped caching with TTL support
  - Transaction Support: Database transactions with automatic rollback
  - Type-Safe Operations: All database operations are fully typed

  ðŸ”§ Next Steps:

  1. Set up PostgreSQL and Redis servers locally/remotely
  2. Copy .env.example â†’ .env and configure your database credentials
  3. Test actual connections using the provided test script
  4. Ready for TASK-004: Tenant Resolution Middleware

  The database connection layer is now fully implemented with production-ready patterns including connection pooling, tenant isolation, comprehensive error handling, and type
   safety!
